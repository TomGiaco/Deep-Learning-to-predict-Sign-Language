# Deep-Learning-to-predict-Sign-Language
In this group work, we use various Deep Learning models in order to perform video classification for sign language dataset: World-Level American Sign Language (WLASL).
The model I focused was a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that translated a video in a 3X3 image and perform image classification on this new dataset. The 3X3 images were created by extracting 9 frames in the middle of the video and they were applied various data augmentation techniques: zoom, speedup, horizontal flip.
